# Weather-App-Api
Use Open Weather API to get updated 10 minute weather forecast near you.

This is my first project gathering information from an external API. 

A unique feature included in the app is the abilty to source images from the area/city requested - so if the city of London was requested then images tagged London on umsplash would appear as a background image.

Once a page is refreshed or a different location is requested, then the background image is updated.
This was an enjoyable project and taught me the basics of using an API to get data from an external source and display it in a clear and easy to read app.

Future updates could include a 5-day, 16 day and 30 day forecast. The API also offers a feature to look back at the weather from upto 40 years ago.
